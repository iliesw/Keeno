### Patch Changes

- [#17](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/pull/17) [`166bbbd`](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/commit/166bbbd16ac91ca825ebe66a4d3713235f1e156a) Thanks [@iliesw](https://github.com/iliesw)! - PR

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#17](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/pull/17) `use:` directives: reusable DOM behaviors written as plain functions (`Directive<Element, Value>`, `(el, value) => cleanup`) and used as `use:name={value}` on any element. They run after insertion, run again (after their cleanup) when the value changes, clean up on removal, don't run during server rendering, and send errors to `<ErrorBoundary>`. The dev tools now show a loading async derived with a `pending` badge instead of an error, without starting a run.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/pull/14) [`62e1633`](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/commit/62e163329431f04df5502c0b874980e7d1743248) Thanks [@iliesw](https://github.com/iliesw)! - Async `derived`: give `derived` an async function and read the value inside the new `<Loading fallback>` boundary. Re-runs keep the current value until the new one arrives (`pending(() => x)` tells you one is in flight), superseded runs are ignored and aborted through the optional `{ signal }` argument, `x.refresh()` runs it again, and rejections go to the closest `<ErrorBoundary>`.

New `renderToStream` sends the page right away with `<Loading>` fallbacks and streams each boundary's content as it becomes ready. Concurrent server renders no longer share the portal outlet, and `init`/`update` mount jobs are never queued on the server.

Includes `snapshot()`, `reconcile()` and `isStore()`, works with keyed lists, and `bind:value` / `bind:checked` accept store properties (`bind:value={form.user.email}`). `store` is available in `.kn` files without importing.

### Minor Changes

- [`6c85982`](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/commit/6c859820b58232e41d06a0592aa441f5065fd99c) Thanks [@iliesw](https://github.com/iliesw)! - In-page dev tools panel (`@inflector/keeno/devtools`), built with Keeno itself and loaded automatically during `vite dev` (Alt+Shift+D, or the ◆ Keeno button):
  
  - Components: a searchable live tree with an inspector for props and named states. Strings, numbers and booleans are edited inline, any state can be edited as JSON, and states with `history` get undo/redo. A link opens the file in your editor, and the selected component is exposed as `$keeno`.
  - Picker (Alt+Shift+C): hover to see which component renders an element, click to select it.
  - Highlight updates: components flash on the page when they re-render, and tree rows show update counts.
  - Timeline: every state write with a structural diff (`todos [1].done false → true`), its source (url/remote/history), errors, filter/pause, and revert to the previous value.
  - Perf: flush timings with a chart, and the components that update most.
  
  The compiler's new `dev` option names states and deriveds after their variables and records each component's source file. The Vite plugin turns it on during `vite dev`; `keeno({ devtools: false })` turns the panel off. `__KEENO_DEVTOOLS__` gains `components()`, `details()`, `set()`, `log()`, `stats()` and `subscribe()`.

### Patch Changes

- [`6c85982`](https://github.com/iliesw/Keeno/commit/6c859820b58232e41d06a0592aa441f5065fd99c) Thanks [@iliesw](https://github.com/iliesw)! - Fix correctness and security bugs:
  
  - keeno: a computation no longer runs after the condition it renders under turned false (re-running its parent first); a derived that failed on its first run notifies readers when it recovers; a throwing `onUpdate` listener no longer leaves computations stale; server rendering supports `<select>` values and `bind:checked`; dynamic inline handler attributes (`onclick` strings) are never set, and spread binds lowercase `onclick` functions as listeners; `onDoubleClick` listens to `dblclick`.
  - compiler: `</script>` inside strings, template literals and comments no longer ends the script; `<style>` inside an inline `<svg>` and data `<script>`s (JSON-LD) stay in the markup; object defaults in `props()` (`items = []`) are evaluated once.
  - router: `href('//x')` no longer gives a protocol-relative URL; `link` leaves links outside the base to the browser; URLs outside the base match no route; server-rendered `<Link>`s use their router's base; `navigate()` fires `keeno:navigate` instead of a fake `popstate`, and scrolls to `#hash` targets.
  - keeno: `<Transition>` cancels running animations when it is destroyed; `mount()` disposes the app when the first render throws; a failed `lazy()` load only affects the instances that were waiting for it; `undo()`/`redo()` keep the history when `validate` refuses the value; `<Portal>` content is included in `renderToString` output, after the app.
  - keeno performance: O(1) scheduler queues and owner removal (clearing long lists is ~30% faster), no per-row index state for `item => …` list callbacks, linear `<Transition>` merging.
  - router: restores the scroll position on back/forward.
  - keeno-check: fails when the tsconfig includes no files (e.g. a solution tsconfig).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`401868e`](https://github.com/iliesw/Lux/commit/401868edbebe68c35af9790f4f63c9bbefdb7ae7) Thanks [@iliesw](https://github.com/iliesw)! - Native reparenting. `reparentable(() => <Video />)` renders content once and lets you show it in different places (`{player}`) while it keeps its component state, and `keyedReparentable()` does the same per key for items that move between lists. Moves use the DOM's native `moveBefore` where available, so iframes, playing media, focus and CSS animations survive them, including moves into a branch that was just created. Keyed list reorders also use `moveBefore` for nodes already in the document. Imperatively, `player.moveTo(element | selector, before?)` and `player.remove()` move or hide the content from code (drag and drop, picture-in-picture), and `moveNode(node, parent, before?)` moves any DOM node natively when possible.
